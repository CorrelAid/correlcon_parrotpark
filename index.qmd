## What is Parrotpark? ü¶ú

- Cooperation with D64 in the context of the project "Code of Conduct: Democratic AI"
- Experimental infrastructure project for self-hosting LLMs and accompanying applications
- Targeted at work in civil society organizations
- Project is finished and ended with an evaluation

## Why self-hosting? 

- Digital Sovereignty
- Dependence, lack of transparency and little control:
    - Data processing (GDPR)
    - Resource consumption
    - Properties and training of the models
    - Model and tool usage/configuration; e.g. web search (üó≤ GUI apps such as GPT Builder)

## How to self-host: LLM hosting options

- LLM inference: 
    -  Azure OpenAI on EU servers - ‚úÖ GDPR
    - **Open models** - ‚úÖ More transparent model characteristics
        - API services hosted in the EU 
        - Dedicated GPU server - ‚úÖ Fully transparent resource consumption (only inference)

## Dedicated vs API: Costs for EU Provider Scaleway

- Claude 4 Opus on Open Router: $15/M input tokens; $75/M output tokens

## Dedicated vs API: Costs for EU Provider Scaleway

- How much VRAM can we afford?: **L4** with 24GB, limits model choices + context window size

## Dedicated vs API: Example Pricing Calculation

- Scaleways allows automated GPU instance creation (unlike Hetzner), so we deploy only during working hours  
    - $\text{Cost} = \text{‚Ç¨}0.75 \times (10\,\text{h} \times 5\,\text{days} \times 4\,\text{weeks}) = \text{‚Ç¨}150$  
    - Including tax (19%): **‚Ç¨178.50**

- Compared to Mistral Small 3.2 24B via OpenRouter (assuming 50/50 input/output split):  
    - ‚Ç¨178.50 = $210.27 (at ‚Ç¨1 = $1.178)  
    - $\frac{\text{\$}105.14}{0.05} + \frac{\text{\$}105.14}{0.10}$ = **3,154M tokens** 
    - Per working day: $\frac{3{,}154}{20} = 158\,\text{M tokens/day}$

## Dedicated vs API: Why Dedicated?

- Maximum control and transparency
- More predictable/fixed costs
- One can fit other services on the GPU server
- Exact metrics on hardware and inference server level

## What to self host? - Which LLM?

- Model size, context and concurrency: 
    - Infrastructure choice limits model options
    - Pre-quantised models on Hugging Face
- Which language and task is the model used for?
    - "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
    - For automated tests: LLM as a judge
- Finetuning vs. Prompt Engineering

## What to self host? - Other required services

- Inference Server: Ollama, vLLM, Hugging Face TGI etc.
- LiteLLM: Control over the API 
- Chat Interface: LibreChat, Open WebUI
- Databases (Vector, Application) and File Storage
- Metrics
- Auth
- MCP/Stuff for Tools, e.g. web search

## Parrotpark Architecture: High Level Overview

![](images/graph.png)]

## Parrotpark Architecture: Misc. Details

- Implementation as Infrastructure as Code (Terraform and Ansible)
    - Nested (Entrance Server periodically runs IaC)
- Metrics scraped with Telegraf and sent to external TimeScale Database, connected to Metabase


## Evaluation

- Time window: June 17th to June 27th (9 working days)
- Scraped Metrics: http://mtbs.correlaid.org/public/dashboard/6032e4e9-e87a-49d7-bd67-f0d92552cc1c
- User Survey

## Evaluation: Tokens and Pricing

- Total processed tokens: **329,503** input / **103,083** output
- ‚ùå API service for the same model would have cost waaaaay less: **$0.027** vs ~(‚Ç¨178.5/2)=‚Ç¨89
